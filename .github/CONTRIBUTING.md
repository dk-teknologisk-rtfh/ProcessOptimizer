ProcessOptimizer is an open-source project and we welcome any type of well-meant contributions. Please look at our code of conduct and license to get further aquainted with us.

Contributions in the form of issue-reports are particularly welcome. If it doesn't work, we want to know about it. Please consider the following when posting a new issue:
- see if any previous issues have reported the same or similar behavior
- state clearly whether your are reporting a bug, suggesting a feature or asking a question. Perhaps even in the title of the issue
- when reporting a bug, please give as much information as you can. i.e. your software-setup, the expected result of your code and the actual result of your code (and of course the code itself)
- when suggesting a feature, please describe a use-case in which the requested feature would solve an issue

Contributions of code in the form of pull requests, are VERY welcome. We kindly ask to follow these guidelines:
- First make a new issue, from which the changes in the code are described/justified. Expect this issue to be a starting point for a friendly discussion
- open a pull request towards 'develop' as early as possible and mark it as a draft or work in progress (WiP)
- link the new PR to the issue
- (one pull request for each problem, please do not pool solutions into swarmed PR's)
- write tests for any new functions/classes (for plotting functions, please manually ensure that they are working under any expected conditions, e.g. with categorical dimensions)
- ensure full passing of old and new tests - and somewhat strict adherence to flake8 analysis
- when the code is ready to be reviewed remove the draft/WiP mark and assign a reviewer
- wait for a succesfull review(!)
- if working from a branch in the repo, please delete the branch after merging to 'develop'
- consider making an example to showcase any new functionalities

And most importantly, remember to keep a friendly and welcoming tone

(Much of our old code is based on the work in the ScikitOptimize project, please consider paying back by also fixing similar issues in their repo)
